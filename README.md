# Mobile App

This is an Android prototype project developed in React Native using Expo to manage and monitor the distribution of school meals.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- npm or yarn installed
- Expo CLI installed globally (optional)

## Steps to run the project

### 1. Enter the `mobile-app` directory

After installing the dependencies, navigate to the `mobile-app` folder where the application code is located:

```bash
cd mobile-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Before starting the project, you need to install all necessary dependencies. Navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
or, if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the project with Expo

To start the project, run the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This command will open the Expo development interface in your browser, allowing you to run the application on an emulator, physical device, or even in the browser (depending on your project settings).

## Note

The API for this project is ready; however, the connection has been disabled, and the app is now functioning solely as a prototype without consuming the API.
